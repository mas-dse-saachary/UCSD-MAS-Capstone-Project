<p><b>Required Text: </b> John B. Fraleigh, "A First Course in Abstract 
  Algebra, 7th 
  Edition", Addison-Wesley, 2003.
<p> Other texts:
<p>1. Joseph J. Rotman, "A First Course in Abstract 
  Algebra, 2nd Edition", Prentice Hall, 2000.
<p> 2.  Michel Artin, "Algebra", Prentice Hall, 1991.
<p> 3. I.N. Herstein, "Abstract Algebra, 3rd edition", Prentice Hall, 1996.
<p> <b> Grading: </b> homework (15%), Midterm Exam 1 on
<b> Thursday February 1, 2018 </b> (25%), Midterm Exam 2 on
  <b>Thursday March 1, 2018</b> (25%), 
  cumulative Final Exam on <b> Tuesday March 20, 2018</b>  (35%).
  Exams will consist of a few theory questions, including definitions
  and proofs, and some problems involving
computations and proofs.  All
exams are closed book and closed notes, no calculators or electronic devices are allowed. There will
  be <b> no </b> make-up exams. If you miss one midterm, then final exam counts 60%. If you take
  both midterms and your grade
  in the final is greater than your lowest midterm grade, then the grade in the midterm gets replaced
  by the grade in the final. For example, if midterm 1 score is 80/100, midterm 2 score is 50/100 and final
  score is 70/100, your score in the second midterm gets replaced by 70/100.  If you choose to be graded "Pass/Fail",  a "Pass" grade reqires a grade of C- or higher.
<p> <b> Homework: </b>  Assignments can be downloaded from this website, no paper copy will be given in class. 
 A grader will grade selected problems.
Discussing homework with others is ok. It is expected that everyone writes in his/her own words the homework solutions.
Homework must be placed before 4:00pm on the due date  in the
drop-box in the basement of APM. No late homework is accepted  and the
two lowest homework grades will be dropped (which can also count for missing assignments). 

<p> <b> Syllabus:</b> basic properties of groups and subgroups,
isomorphisms, permutations, quotient groups  - as in (parts of) section 0 and chapters 1,2,3,7 of book.
<p> <b> Outline: </b> course will be devoted to "preliminaries" and 
  "group theory" (section 0 and chapters 1,2,3,7 in book).  There will be no time to cover all of the sections 
  in each chapter and not all sections will be covered in the same depth. Class time is
  for the fundamental concepts of each chapter. Fraleigh's book (and also the
  other books) are sources for further explanations and examples. The
following is an approximate plan. Content covered will
be added/updated below as the course progresses (numbers refer to sections in
Fraleigh's book).
